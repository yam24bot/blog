# Trix for Ruby on Rails

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/kylefox/trix.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/kylefox/trix)

Want to include Basecamp's awesome [Trix WYSIWYG
editor](http://trix-editor.org) in your Ruby on Rails application?
You've come to the right place!

Compatible with Rails 4.2 and up.

# Installation

Add `trix-rails` to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'trix-rails', require: 'trix'
```

Run `bundle install` and restart your server to make the files available through the pipeline.

Import Trix styles in `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`:

```css
*= require trix
```

Require Trix Javascript magic in `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`:

```js
//= require trix
```

# Usage

You can use `trix-rails` as a standalone tag, in a form builder, or with popular form libraries.

## Standalone Tag

Create a simple `<trix-editor>` tag:

```ruby
trix_editor_tag(name, value = nil, options = {})
```

For example:

```erb
<%= trix_editor_tag :post, :body, required: true %>
```

## Form builder

Create a Trix editor for a `form_for` or `form_with` attribute:

```ruby
trix_editor(method, options = {})
```

For example:

```erb
<%= post_form.trix_editor :body, required: true, autofocus: true %>
```

## Formtastic and Simple Form

If you're using [Formtastic](https://github.com/justinfrench/formtastic) or [Simple Form](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form), you can do this:

```ruby
f.input :body, as: :trix_editor
```

## Options

Any `options` provided will be passed along to the [`content_tag`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/TagHelper.html#method-i-content_tag) call that outputs the `<trix-editor>` tag.

For example:

```erb
<%= post_form.trix_editor :body, autofocus: true, data: { coffee: :delicious } %>
```

will render:

```html
<trix-editor autofocus="true" data-coffee="delicious">
```

# Contributing

* [Request a feature](https://github.com/kylefox/trix/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)

## Testing

`trix-rails` uses [Appraisal](https://github.com/thoughtbot/appraisal) to test against supported versions of Rails. You can run the specs against all supported versions with:

```shell
bundle exec appraisal rake spec
```

## Upgrading Trix

To upgrade Trix, simply copy the _compiled_ styles from [`trix/dist`](https://github.com/basecamp/trix/tree/master/dist) into this repository:

- Copy [`trix.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/basecamp/trix/master/dist/trix.js) to `vendor/assets/javascripts/trix.js`
- Copy [`trix.css`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/basecamp/trix/master/dist/trix.css) to `vendor/assets/stylesheets/trix.css`
